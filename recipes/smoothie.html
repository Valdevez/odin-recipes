        This is probably Moose's MOST ABUSED recipe. Since he is a (recovering) sugar addict, he would make at least 1 daily. 
        This got him his sugar fix without giving him the worry that he is consuming harmful ingredients like coloring,
        sucralose, aspartame, corn syrup, etc.

    <h1>Ingredients</h1> 

    <ul>
        <li>Bananas</li>
        <li>Frozen Strawberries</li>
        <li>Honey</li>
        <li>Water</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Steps</h1>

    <ol>
        <li>Cut bananas into slices and throw into blender</li>
        <li>Throw 5-6 frozen strawberries</li>
        <li>Add 1/4th cup of water</li>
        <li>Add tablespoon of honey (more can never hurt)</li>
        <li>Blend and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
        <p>
            A big reason you want to cut your bananas is so you actually have space in the blender to add everything else.
            Adding the frozen strawberries after the bananas ensure that the blades hit them first. I've done it reversed 
            order before and have found big chunks of strawberry.

            Although this smoothie is high in sugar, I still believe it to be a GREAT substitute for any soda or 
            Arizona iced tea for example. This is because they use TONS of awful ingredients to make your drink
            taste sweet. On top of that, the fruits contain natural enzymes that won't spike your insulin as these
            drinks normally would.
