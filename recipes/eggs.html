    <p>This recipe for scrambled eggs is one you will never get
        tired of. It's definitely a different consistency as to
        what most people are used to, but once you try it, you
        can never go back. Here's how to consistently make them
        perfect every time:
        <h1>Ingredients</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Eggs</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>Green Onion</li>
            <li>Salt & Pepper</li>

    <h1>Steps</h1>
        <ol>
        <li>Melt a quarter stick of butter in pan on
                medium heat.</li>
        <li>Crack 3 eggs, and begin stirring</li>
        <li><strong>Do not</strong> stop stirring.</li>
        <li>As eggs begin to solidify, take off stove
                periodically. Think on and off in intervals of 10 
                seconds.</li>
        <li>When they get to consistency shown in picture
                above, add your salt, pepper, and sliced green onion.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>

        <p>The key is putting salt and pepper <em>after</em>
        you have already cooked the eggs. This prevents the 
        egg from turning too dry.</p>
